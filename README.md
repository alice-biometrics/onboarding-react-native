## Installation :computer:

Add the ALiCE Onboarding React Native Component:

```console
yarn add aliceonboarding-reactnative
```

or just add the following code to your package.json

```json
"aliceonboarding-reactnative": "{VERSION}",
                                    ^
                                    |_____ Set the version
```

Then, install it as usual:

```console
yarn install
```

> iOS <img src="https://github.com/alice-biometrics/custom-emojis/blob/master/images/ios.png" width="16">

Installing dependencies with `cocoapods` is required:

```console
yarn cocoapods # equivalent to cd ios; pod install; cd ..
```

:new:

If your Podfile `post_install` does not set the `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION` flag to `YES`, you need to set it for both `Alamofire` and `Yams` pods at their `Build Options` settings.

## Demos :rocket:

We recommend you to start by testing the demos. 

> iOS <img src="https://github.com/alice-biometrics/custom-emojis/blob/master/images/ios.png" width="16">

```console
yarn ios #Â or npx react-native run-ios
```

Or just open the XCode workspace and run it manually:

```console
open ios/AppOnboardingSample.xcworkspace/
```

---

> Android <img src="https://github.com/alice-biometrics/custom-emojis/blob/master/images/android.png" width="16">

```console
npx react-native run-android
```

Or just open the Android Studio workspace and run it manually.

> React Native Server <img src="https://github.com/alice-biometrics/custom-emojis/blob/master/images/react-native.png" width="16">

Plase note that a react-native server running is required for both platforms. Run it manually with:

```console
yarn start # react-native start
```

## Integration :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### Setup

> iOS <img src="https://github.com/alice-biometrics/custom-emojis/blob/master/images/ios.png" width="16">

Considerations: 
* Add camera permission to your app. Find more info [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/cameras_and_media_capture/requesting_authorization_for_media_capture_on_ios).
* We strongly recommended to lock app orientation to portrait.
* Update AppOnboardingSample/ios/Podfile in order to fit iOS minimum deployment target. Additionaly, add use_frameworks! to your Podfile.

  ```
  use_frameworks!
  platform :ios, '11.0'
  ```

---

> Android <img src="https://github.com/alice-biometrics/custom-emojis/blob/master/images/android.png" width="16">

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url  "https://dl.bintray.com/alice-biometrics/alicebiometrics"
        }
    }
```

Considerations:

* The SDK requires at least API 21. So remember to set `minSdkVersion = 21`.
* Add camera permisions to your app, and Add AliceActivity.
   - Modify `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` this:

       ```xml
       <manifest>
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" /> 
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /> 
         <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
         <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" /> 
        
         <application
          <activity android:name="com.rnalice.AliceActivity" />
        </application>
       </manifest>
       ```

* We strongly recommended to lock app orientation to portrait.


### Import the library

```js
import Onboarding from 'aliceonboarding-reactnative';
```

### Configuration
	
You can configure the onboarding flow with a simple dictionary:

```js
const ONBOARDING_CONFIG = {
    "stages": [
        {"stage": "addSelfie"},
        {"stage": "addDocument", "type": "idcard"},
    ]
}
```

You can also specify the `issuingCountry`, otherwise user can select it with a menu.

```js
const ONBOARDING_CONFIG = {
    "stages": [
        {"stage": "addSelfie"},
        {"stage": "addDocument", "type": "idcard", "issuingCountry": "ESP"},
    ]
}
```

**Available Stages:** 
* `addSelfie`: It includes a selfie capturer.
* `addDocument`: It includes a document capturer. Additionally, you can configure the `type` of document and the `issuingCountry`.
	* `type` (**required**): Available documents (*idcard, driverlicense, passport, residencepermit*).
	* `issuingCountry` (**optional**): 
		You can select an `issuingCountry` from those supported by ALiCE Onboarding. Please, check code and available countries  [here](https://docs.alicebiometrics.com/onboarding/supported_docs.html). 
		Otherwise, if no `issuingCountry`is passed, it will be requested from the user via a pop-up menu.


Please note that the `passport` type does not require specification of `issuingCountry`.

### Run ALiCE Onboarding

Add our React Native component in your application adding:

```html
<Onboarding
  userToken={userToken}
  config={ONBOARDING_CONFIG}
  onSuccess={(userStatusJson) => console.log("onSuccess:" + userStatusJson) }
  onFailure={(failureJson) => console.log("onFailure:" + failureJson) }
  onCancel={(value) => console.log("onCancel:" + value) }
/>
```

Where:
 * `userToken` is used to secure requests made by the users on their mobile devices or web clients. You should obtain it from your Backend (see [Authentication :closed_lock_with_key:](#authentication-closed_lock_with_key)).
 * `userStatusJson` is a json with user status information, here you can find the `user_id` and information about a successful onboarding. 
 * `failureJson` is a json with information about an unexpected failure.

see an example [here](app/components/OnboardingProduction/index.js)

## Authentication :closed_lock_with_key:

How can we get the `userToken` to start testing ALiCE Onboarding technology?

`AliceOnboarding` can be used with two differnet authentication modes:

* Trial (Using ALiCE Onboarding Sandbox): Recommended only in the early stages of integration.
    - Pros: This mode does not need backend integration.
    - Cons: Security compromises. It must be used only for develpment and testing.
* Production (Using your Backend): In a production deployment we strongly recommend to use your backend to obtain required TOKENS.
    - Pros: Full security level. Only your backend is able to do critical operations.
    - Cons: Needs some integration in your backend.

### Trial

If you want to test the technology without integrate it with your backend, you can use our Sandbox Service. This service associates a user mail with the ALiCE Onboarding `user_id`. You can create a user and obtain his `USER_TOKEN` already linked with the email.

Add our React Native component in your application adding:

```html
<OnboardingWithSandbox
  sandboxToken={sandboxToken}
  email={email}
  firstName={firstName}
  lastName={lastName}
  config={ONBOARDING_CONFIG}
  onSuccess={(userStatusJson) => console.log("onSuccess:" + userStatusJson) }
  onFailure={(failureJson) => console.log("onFailure:" + failureJson) }
  onCancel={(value) => console.log("onCancel:" + value) }
/>
```
Where `sandboxToken` is a temporary token for testing the technology in a development/testing environment. 

An `email` is required to associate it to an ALiCE Onboarding `user_id`. You can also add some additional information from your user as `firstName` and `lastName`.

see an example [here](app/components/OnboardingTrial/index.js)

For more information about the Sandbox, please check the following [doc](https://docs.alicebiometrics.com/onboarding/access.html#using-alice-onboarding-sandbox).

### Production

On the other hand, for production environments we strongly recommend to use your backend to obtain the required `USER_TOKEN`.

```html
<Onboarding
  userToken={this.getUserTokenFromMyBackend()}
  config={ONBOARDING_CONFIG}
  onSuccess={(userStatusJson) => console.log("onSuccess:" + userStatusJson) }
  onFailure={(failureJson) => console.log("onFailure:" + failureJson) }
  onCancel={(value) => console.log("onCancel:" + value) }
/>
```

## Onboarding Commands :wrench:

ALiCE Onboarding Client SDK can be used in two different ways, by commands (OnboardingCommands) or by full flow (Onboarding).
The commands allow you to open the grabber and do a series of operations independently. Available operations are as follows:

* Get User Status
* Add Selfie
* Create Document
* Add Document
* Get Supported Documents
* Authenticate
* Get Supported Documents

Please, see [Onboarding Commands Documentation](doc/OnboardingCommands.md) for more info.

## Customisation :gear:

To improve the onboarding experience into your look and feel, ALiCE onboarding allows you to customise onboarding stages using your style.

You can use a general configuration, to a rapid customisation both in Android and iOS:
